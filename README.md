"Machine Learning Classification Project"

Breat cancer detection whther the patient has a malignant or benign type with the use of 3 Machine Learning Classification algorithms : Decision Tree , Random Forest, K Nearest Neighbor.

The dataset chosen for the analysis is presenting data on breast cancer examination results of 569 patients, consisting of the real-valued features for each breast cancer cell.
Before data pre-processing dataset consisted of 33 attributes and 569 records, nevertheless, two variables were removed. One column consisted of null values,
whereas another one presented identification numbers of patients. 
The dataset shape was extracted to 31 variables.  errors.  Dataset consists of the real-valued features for each breast cancer cell.
