# Machine Learning Classification
# Breast cancer detection whether the patient has a malignant or benign type using 3 Machine Learning Classification algorithms : Decision Tree , Random Forest, K Nearest Neighbor.

The dataset chosen for the analysis presents data on breast cancer examination results of 569 patients, consisting of the real-valued features for each breast cancer cell.
Before the data pre-processing dataset consisted of 33 attributes and 569 records, nevertheless, two variables were removed. One column consisted of null values,
whereas another one presented the identification numbers of patients. 
The dataset shape was extracted from 31 variables.  errors.  The dataset consists of the real-valued features for each breast cancer cell.
